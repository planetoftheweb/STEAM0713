# The Next 50
by Ray Villalobos

>> Author Notes:

Today, I want to talk to you about a topic I call the next 50...It's about what I've learned about what works in my six years of teaching for lynda.com and LinkedIn Learning. I hope that some of this can be useful to you.

## Who is Ray?

- Senior Staff Author, [Lynda.com](https://lynda.com)/[LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)
- 50+ [courses in the library](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/ray-villalobos)
- Front-end/Full-stack Dev

>> Author Notes:

- Of course I work for Lynda.com and LinkedIn Learning. As you may know, Lynda.com was acquired by LinkedIn and LinkedIn Learning is essentially Lynda.com content available within LinkedIn. The one cool thing about having being acquired by LinkedIn is that it's is a legit social media platform and that's something that we've never had at Lynda, so we hope that in the future we can bring some better social media integration into what we do at Lynda.com.

- So far, I've published more than 50 courses into the library, which is pretty good. I've published about 12 courses a year for six years. Sometimes, they end up being upgrades to existing courses, and sometimes they're retired.

- I specialize int the front end and full stack development segment, so I teach things like AngularJS, NodeJS, Bootstrap, React and a bunch of other topics.

## Why we do this

<small style="width: 70% font-family: ">“I’ve been working in the health care industry for 15 years. Two years ago I realized that I needed a change...I decided to learn web development...I started with the basics, then expanded with responsive design, Ajax, Node.js, Express, React...I have learned many of these technologies from your courses. Last week, I finally got a break with a job as an App Developer...just wanted to say thank you! I look forward to more of your content.” --**Mike** (edited)

>> Author Notes:

As educators, I know that we all have our own stories of successes, but I wanted to share one of mine that I received recently that meant a lot. I've edited the message to make it a bit shorter and this isn't the name or the photo, but the thoughts are essentially there.

The reason I'm an educator is because I want to make a difference in people's life. Ocasionally, I hear back from people like this and it reminds me of the struggles that I faced as a career switcher and the help I received from online training. Ultimately, when I'm in my dark studio recording a course by myself, I try to think of people like this, who can maybe have a better life because of my efforts, so before I start telling you how, I don't want you to forget why.

I was lucky enough to work on some great products, including designing some big websites for Tribune Interactive and creating a network of radio and TV station sites from scratch, but nothing compares to receiving a note from someone who was able to change their life and maybe improve the lives of their loved ones because of something I was a part of.

## How I got here

- Quitting Something
- Adjunct at a Community College (15 yrs)
- Recorded courses for my students
- Got a Job with Lynda.com

>> Author Notes:

- I started teaching in high school as a lab assistant, helping others with computer problems. things got really serious when I decided to quit the basketball team. I came to the tough realization that there was no future for me in professional sports, so with all of the free time, I decided to work as a lab assistant and help others in High School and then college.

- Computer Science wasn't exactly right for me, so I ended up getting a degree in Journalism and worked as a graphic designer in a print shop. Eventually I ended up as an Adjunct for a small community college.

- I found out about the power of online training when I realized that if I recorded what I was teaching my students, then it was much easier for them to absorb at their own pace and it helped me move the class along faster...that's one of the super powers of online training. I've used it for years in the classroom and students love it.

- I applied for the lynda.com job three times. I had written a book by then and learned something about writing proposals, but the first two times I wrote proposals for courses that I WANTED to do, instead of thinking about the market. The third time, I tried something different and prepared a proposal for a course they didn't have that sounded interesting. 'Analytics for Designers'. Once I got through, I ended up doing a course on HTML and CSS.

## “It's for the benefit of the cat”

>> Author Notes:

- That's one of the first bits of wisdom I want to leave you with. With online training, you have to remember that what is successful isn't necessarily what you WANT to do, you have to think about what people need, what they want to learn do things for the benefit of others. Sometimes, that will lead you to push yourself to learn and try things that you wouldn't otherwise do.

- Is it going to help someone get a job? Is this a current skill? Is this a skill that's in demand?

- To this day, I find that although I'm a staff author, I have to teach about things that people want to know about. I still write proposals in my job, and have to get content managers and others excited about what I'll be teaching.

## Course Development Process

- Write a Proposal
- Create an Outline
- Prepare Assets/Scripts
- Record Course

>> Author Notes:

- Does anyone recognize this background? It's from one of my favorite episodes of Battlestar Galactica. It's called 33 and the concept was that the cylons were attacking the humans every 33 seconds, so since I produce 12 courses a year, the flow feels a bit like that episode. This is obviously oversimplified a bit here.

- First, I write a proposal for a course and we've already covered some of that, but the proposal has a summary of the course, a list of learning goals, a description of the audience, prerequisites, audience level, software needed, description of the assets you'll provide, equiment required as well as a proposed Table of Contents. It's usually something you do sometimes months before you record the course.

- The next part is probably the hardest, you prepare the assets, which in my case is usually the website or app I'll be building throughout the course and then write the scripts for each video I'll need to record. I'll talk more about this through this presentation, so I'll leave it as that for now.

- Finally, you record the course. This is probably the most fun part for me. We really have a fantastic team of people that help us make our stuff amazing. For newer authors, a producer is assigned to you to help you go through the process and stay on track. As a Staff Author, the Producer's job is a bit more like a project coordinator. One of the things that sets us apart is the production quality as well as the testing and editing that happens. Every course gets watched and edited by professional editors and for our code courses, beta testers take the courses to make sure everything works.

## Edit Everything

“I didn't have time to write a short letter,<br>so I wrote a long one instead.” <small>-- Mark Twain</small>

>> Author Notes:
You've probably heard this quote from Mark Twain before and it's one of the secret to great courses...editing.

And I mean editing in every sense of the process. Editing the videos to make sure they're shorter...of course, but also editing your scripts so that you're not rambling and losing people's interest. Finally, editing the structure of your outline and your individual videos.

---

# Successful Editing

- Each video/code a single, complete thought
- 2-4 minutes for explaining concepts
- 5-15 minutes for typing code
- Pretend like you don't know it

>> Author Notes:

- Make each video like a paragraph and explain a complete thought. Take a look at your code examples and make sure that even your code doesn't have things you don't need. Type only the things that need explanation, you can copy and paste other stuff or bring in code that's already typed.

- If you're explaining conceptual subjects, make each no more than 4 minutes and use visual aids if possible or at least slide shows (please don't show all of the text at once)

<!--- If you're coding something, make sure your code is focused, don't add code you don't need. 5-15 minutes long. Show how to code something once, then you can insert code from a gist or copy and paste code. Type only the things that will enhance explanation.-->

- The most important thing is remember what it was like not to know this and make sure you're describing why you're doing something

## REAL CYLONS HAVE A PLAN

>> Author Notes:

- Great courses have great plans, so make sure you take the time to think about the goals for your course, but also for the individual videos.

---

# Common Problems

- About the author's knowledge
- Try to cover too much
- Cover material already covered elsewhere
- Have no learning goals for each video
- Explain jargon with other jargon

>> Author Notes:

- Too many presentations are often about showcasing the level of knowledge of the author, or about what the presenter knows or has done, but remember that it's for the benefit of the cat, so make sure your goal is to help someone get to your level of knowledge, not to showcase how awesome you are.

- Another mistake I see is that authors often try to cover too much material. You have to edit and simplify the content. Don't show too much code, only show what they need to understand the concept...no more and no less.

- A lot of authors also feel like they have to cover lots of background material that has already been explained by other courses. Just refer people to those courses and teach a specific topic.

- Ask yourself: When someone watches this video, they will understand how to do ______ ?

- Assume people aren't familiar with your acronyms...almost always. For example, when writing the Angular JS course, every time I mentioned the MCV model, I explained that it was a Model View Controller and often mentioned that the model is the data, the view is the template and the controller the javascript that combines both.

## Culinary Point of View?

>> Author Notes:

- One of my favorite shows is Food Network Star and it always has two or three judges. In this season the judges were Bobby Flay, Giada De Laurentiis and Alton Brown. each of these chefs has a specific style (Southwestern Bold Flavors, Everyday Italian and Food Scientist) and one of the first things they teach potential stars is that they should each have their own and unique culinary point of view.

- This is what makes each person unique as a brand. One of the things I did wrong when I first got started is to try to be like some of the other teachers I loved. I don't have James Williamson's voice or Morten's personality, but I'm my own person with a specific point of view that's in my DNA. It's important to find out who you are and make sure you're consistent.

---

## My point of view

- Practical 
- Real world
- Project based
- Clear style

>> Author Notes:

- So, for me, my point of view is first of all practical. I want to show you things that you need to know in order to do your job well. The things I enjoy teaching are the same things I like to learn. I want to know how to do my job better or things that I can use.

- I want real world examples, I don't like for Hello World code samples because I can't usually figure out why I'd use that. I prefer examples that show me realistic use cases.

- I learn better by doing something and whenever I apply concepts into projects, I learn a lot more from doing and iterating on projects than just listening to someone talk about concepts.

- I enjoy clear explanations, I'll do my best to explain things without assuming you know the jargon. For example, I don't like to use ES6 arrow functions because they can be less clear and although you need to know them, I always ask myself what the lesson is really about. I'll always try to use the simplest code available that's practical.

## Ray “Gene Hackman” Villalobos


>> Author Notes:

- So, if I were an actor, I think I'd like to be like two time academy award winner Gene Hackman. A fantastic actor who didn't always play the flashiest parts or the leading man, but was fantastic in every character he played, which was for the most part working class, blue collar characters who excelled at their work.

## Editing yourself

- Smile before recording
- Double smile before live action
- You're helping a friend
- Practice makes peace

>> Author Notes:

- This sounds silly, but try to think of something that will put you in a good mood before you record. This is especially hard after the 8th take, but nevertheless, it will make a difference in how you sound.

- If you're recording live action, remember that the camera tends to tune people down, so you'll need to exaggerate a bit to look normal. Also, smile at the beginning and at the end, that will also help you sound better.

- One of the first things I learned about the lynda style was that we're supposed to be helping others, so pretend that you're helping a good friend learn something. Try to develop that special connection when you start recording, this is especially tough when you're recording by yourself.

- The more you practice, the better you'll be at recording or perfoming, so try volunteering for meetups and find other ways to present or record yourself.

# Tools & Methodology


>> Author Notes:

Let's take a look at how I use techology to prepare courses. 

---

## Writing the course

- Write in Markdown [https://stackedit.io](Writing)
- Slides with [RevealJS](lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)
- Sync with [https://www.dropbox.com/](Dropbox)
- Use [Github](https://github.com/planetoftheweb?tab=repositories)

>> Author Notes:

- First, I write all of my materials using markdown
- I use a presentation framework called RevealJS to create slides as well as the notes for each video.
- I sync everything using dropbox. I often work with multiple computers and tablets, so it's important that things are backed up and remain in sync.
- I use Git and Github extensively with my courses. Each video that has files that the student needs to work with gets a branch.

---

## RayVeal

- Reveal.js based [presentation framework](http://www.raybo.org/rayveal)
- [Write](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/nextgen/tree/master/docs/slides) with Markdown
- [Syntax Highlighting](http://www.raybo.org/rayveal/#/12)
- Embed [Anything](http://www.raybo.org/rayveal/#/13)
- Easier to Publish/Include as docs

>> Author Notes:
- I created my own version of RevealJS called RayVeal. It's a bit different than the regular reveal.js.

- The main difference is that it assumes that you are going to write all of your slides with markdown.

- One of the big advantages is that it's really easy to work with code. It's color coded and editable by default.

- You can also embed anything like video, but also codepens for some live coding within your slides.

- Another difference is that all of the files are placed in a docs folder, which you can easily add to an existing project and serve with Github Pages.

---

## Git &amp; Github

- Because of [this course](https://www.lynda.com/Bootstrap-tutorials/Bootstrap-3-Advanced-Web-Development/124079-2.html)
- Exercise Files/node_modules

>> Author Notes:
As I mentioned, I use Git and Github for my courses because it allows me to keep file sizes way down. It also gives the students a really useful resource where they can interact with my content.
